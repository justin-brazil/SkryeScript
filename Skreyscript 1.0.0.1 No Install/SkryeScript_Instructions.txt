SKRYESCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

Skryescript is a text file script search utility that allows you to organize and search text-based files in multiple directories using a header-based tagging system called JustinML.  

The idea is to allow you to quickly and easily search your script libraries and filter your results.

There are 3 modes - script search, logs, and results - logs and results can be used to quickly and easily locate the output from the scripts you run throughout your environment.
