SkreyScript v 1.0.0.1
---------------------
Release Date 11/23/2016

First succesful build has been released.  

Installs into C:\Program Files (or C:\Program Files x86 if 32-bit).
Welcome splash screen runs on first launch

Bugs and Issues:
	* Files opened in notepad.exe freeze the script until terminated (may require Start-Process to launch using different PID)
	* Need to find out why returning to "SCRIPTS" mode is so slow and processes the filterlist checkbox function so many times


Future tasks:
	* Set Index-JustML to run as background job.
	* Clear button to reset Search button (perhaps replacing it once executed?)
	* Need to write name-based indexing of scripts when JustML parsing fails
	* Need to write JustML batch import utility and include on setup page.
	* Need to tweak icon file to look better when small
	* Add x86 installers to MSI
	* Create source-based build 
	* Publish and open source
	* Include license file
	* Publish JustML specifications
